 I'm a passionate and detail-oriented frontend developer with a recent degree in Computer Science. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I'm constantly expanding my skillset to stay up-to-date with the latest web technologies.<br><br>

During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience through internships and projects, where I honed my skills in building visually appealing and responsive websites that deliver seamless user experiences. I take pride in writing clean and maintainable code, and I'm always eager to learn and apply best practices to create high-quality web applications.<br><br>

With a keen eye for design and a user-centric approach, I believe that great frontend development is about crafting beautiful and intuitive interfaces that enhance user engagement. I'm also passionate about optimizing website performance to ensure smooth and efficient user interactions.<br><br>

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with new web technologies, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm excited about the endless possibilities of frontend development and always strive to deliver exceptional results that exceed client expectations.<br><br>

I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations, so let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your next project!
